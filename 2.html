 <h3>Demographics of Silicon Valley</h3>
<p>
 Depending on what geographic regions are included in the meaning of the term,
 the population of Silicon Valley is between 3.5 and 4 million.
 A 1999 study by AnnaLee Saxenian for the Public Policy Institute of California reported
 that a third of Silicon Valley scientists and engineers were immigrants
 and that nearly a quarter of Silicon Valley's high-technology firms since 1980 were run by Chinese (17 percent)
 or Indian descent CEOs (7 percent). There is a stratum of well-compensated technical employees and managers,
 including 10s of thousands of "single-digit millionaires".
 This income and range of assets will support a middle-class lifestyle in Silicon Valley.
