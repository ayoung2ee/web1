 <h3>Economy of Silicon Valley</h3>
<p>
  The San Francisco Bay Area has the largest concentration of high-tech companies
  in the United States, at 387,000 high-tech jobs, of which Silicon Valley accounts for 225,300 high-tech jobs.
  Silicon Valley has the highest concentration of high-tech workers of any metropolitan area,
  with 285.9 out of every 1,000 private-sector workers.Silicon Valley has the highest average high-tech salary
  in the United States at $144,800.Largely a result of the high technology sector, the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara,
  CA Metropolitan Statistical Area has the most millionaires and the most billionaires in the United States per capita.
  <br><br>The region is the biggest high-tech manufacturing center in the United States.
  The unemployment rate of the region was 9.4% in January 2009 and has decreased
  to a record low of 2.7% as of August 2019 Silicon Valley received 41% of all U.S. venture investment in 2011,
  and 46% in 2012 More traditional industries also recognize the potential of high-tech development,
  and several car manufacturers have opened offices in Silicon Valley to capitalize on its entrepreneurial ecosystem.
  <br><br>Manufacture of transistors is, or was, the core industry in Silicon Valley.
  The production workforce was for the most part composed of Asian and Latino immigrants who were paid low wages
  and worked in hazardous conditions due to the chemicals used
  in the manufacture of integrated circuits. Technical, engineering, design,
  and administrative staffs were in large part well compensated.

  <h4>Housing</h4>
  Silicon Valley has a severe housing shortage, caused by the market imbalance between jobs created and housing units built: from 2010 to 2015,
  many more jobs have been created than housing units built. (400,000 jobs, 60,000 housing units)
  This shortage has driven home prices extremely high, far out of the range of production workers.
  As of 2016 a two-bedroom apartment rented for about $2,500 while the median home price was about $1 million.
  The Financial Post called Silicon Valley the most expensive U.S. housing region.
  Homelessness is a problem with housing beyond the reach of middle-income residents;
  there is little shelter space other than in San Jose which, as of 2015, was making an effort to develop shelters by renovating old hotels.
